        <h1>Understanding the Tithi Method</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>What is a Tithi?</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Tithi</strong> is a lunar day in the Hindu calendar. It represents the time it takes for the longitudinal angle 
                between the moon and the sun to increase by 12 degrees. There are 30 Tithis in a lunar month, divided into two 
                <strong>Pakshas</strong> (fortnights):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Krishna Paksha</strong>: The waning phase of the moon (15 Tithis).</li>
                <li><strong>Shukla Paksha</strong>: The waxing phase of the moon (15 Tithis).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>How Tithis are Used in This Calculator</h2>
            <p>
                In this calculator, time is measured in Tithis instead of standard solar days. Each Tithi is treated as equivalent 
                to one day for simplicity. This allows users to calculate compound interest based on traditional Hindu timekeeping.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the calculator accounts for <strong>Adhik Maas</strong> (extra month), which is added periodically to 
                align the lunar calendar with the solar year. This ensures precise calculations that respect both cultural and 
                astronomical principles.

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                The Tithi system has been used for thousands of years in Hinduism for religious, agricultural, and astrological purposes. 
                It reflects the deep connection between timekeeping and natural phenomena, such as the phases of the moon.

            <h2>Why Use the Tithi Method?</h2>
            <p>
                Using the Tithi method in financial calculations offers a unique way to connect modern finance with traditional practices. 
                It provides a culturally meaningful perspective on time and growth, making financial planning more engaging for users 
                who value ancient wisdom.
