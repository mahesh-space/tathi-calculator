            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                This compound interest calculator is designed to help users calculate the growth of their investments over time. 
                What makes this tool unique is its integration of the <strong>Tithi method</strong>, a traditional Hindu timekeeping system, 
                to measure time periods. By combining modern financial principles with ancient cultural practices, this tool offers 
                a fresh perspective on financial planning.

            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
            <p>
                The Tithi method is derived from the Hindu lunar calendar, which divides time into lunar days (Tithis). 
                Each Tithi represents a specific phase of the moon and holds cultural and religious significance in Hinduism. 
                By using this method, the calculator not only provides accurate financial calculations but also connects users 
                to a rich cultural heritage.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                The motivation behind this tool is to bridge the gap between modern financial practices and traditional timekeeping systems. 
                By incorporating the Tithi method, we aim to make financial planning more meaningful and culturally relevant for users 
                who value ancient wisdom.
