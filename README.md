# Compound Interest Calculator with Tithi Method

## Overview
This project is a **Compound Interest Calculator** that integrates the traditional **Tithi method** of Hindu timekeeping. It allows users to calculate compound interest while measuring time using Tithis (lunar days) and accounts for **Adhik Maas** (extra months) for precise calculations. The tool is designed to bridge modern financial practices with ancient cultural wisdom, offering a unique and meaningful user experience.

## Features
1. **Compound Interest Calculator**:
   - Calculate compound interest using the Tithi method for timekeeping.
   - Supports different compounding frequencies (annually, quarterly, monthly).

2. **Tithi Method Integration**:
   - Time is measured in Tithis (lunar days) instead of standard solar days.
   - Accounts for **Adhik Maas** (extra months) to ensure precise calculations.

3. **Hybrid Interest Calculation**:
   - Uses **simple interest** for durations less than 1 year.
   - Uses **compound interest** for durations of 1 year or more.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
   - Includes a **hamburger menu** for mobile navigation.

5. **Dynamic Visualization**:
   - Displays a chart to visualize the growth of the investment over time.

6. **Educational Content**:
   - Includes an **About** page and a **Tithi Method** page to provide context and cultural significance.

## How It Works
1. **Inputs**:
   - Enter the **principal amount**, **annual interest rate**, and **compounding frequency**.
   - Select the **start date** and **end date** using the Tithi-based calendar (year, month, Paksha, and Tithi).

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The tool calculates the total time period in **Tithis** (lunar days).
   - Adjusts for **Adhik Maas** (extra months) to ensure accuracy.

3. **Interest Calculation**:
   - For durations less than 1 year, the tool uses the **simple interest formula**:
     \[
     \text{Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
     \]
   - For durations of 1 year or more, the tool uses the **compound interest formula**:
     \[
     \text{Amount} = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{n \times 100}\right)^{n \times T}
     \]
     Where:
     - \( P \) = Principal amount
     - \( R \) = Annual interest rate
     - \( T \) = Time in years
     - \( n \) = Compounding frequency

4. **Results**:
   - Displays the total amount, interest earned, and time period.
   - Shows a chart to visualize the growth of the investment.
